# Initialize Code Quality Tooling

> **Hard rule: Biome exclusively. Never install ESLint or Prettier alongside Biome.**
> If either already exists in the project, migrate and remove them before scaffolding anything else.

This skill guides you through setting up all code quality tooling for a Midnight Network project. Follow the 3-step flow below in order: detect the project type, handle any conflicting tools, then scaffold the appropriate configuration.

## 3-Step Flow

### Step 1 — Detect Project Type

Scan the project root to determine what kind of project this is. Detection is not mutually exclusive — a project can be both a Compact project and a frontend DApp.

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Any `.compact` file exists | Compact contract project → add Vitest with simulator |
| `package.json` contains `react`, `next`, `vue`, or `svelte` dep | Frontend / DApp → add Playwright E2E |
| `.eslintrc.*` or `.prettierrc.*` (any extension) exists | Conflict detected → migrate before scaffolding |
| `biome.json` already exists | Partial setup → extend rather than overwrite |

Check all signals before proceeding. Record findings; they drive Step 3.

### Step 2 — Detect and Migrate Conflicts

If `.eslintrc.*` or `.prettierrc.*` files are present, migrate them before creating any new config.

**ESLint migration:**

```bash
npx @biomejs/biome migrate eslint --write --include-inspired
```

**Prettier migration:**

```bash
npx @biomejs/biome migrate prettier --write
```

**After migration, remove:**

- All ESLint packages: `eslint`, `@typescript-eslint/*`, `eslint-plugin-*`, `eslint-config-*`
- All Prettier packages: `prettier`, `prettier-plugin-*`
- Config files: `.eslintrc.*`, `.eslintignore`, `.prettierrc.*`, `.prettierignore`
- Remove scripts referencing `eslint` or `prettier` from `package.json`

**Migration limitations — review manually after running:**

| Limitation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| YAML config files (`.eslintrc.yaml`, `.eslintrc.yml`) | Migrate by hand; the CLI does not parse YAML |
| ESLint rule option gaps | Some rules have no Biome equivalent — log them and close the gap with code review |
| `eslint-disable` comments | Convert to `biome-ignore` or remove if the rule no longer applies |
| Prettier `overrides` per file glob | Reproduce in `biome.json` `overrides` array manually |

If no conflicts are found, skip to Step 3.

### Step 3 — Scaffold Based on Detection

Always scaffold the following regardless of project type:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `biome.json` | Linting, formatting, and import sorting — single source of truth |
| `.editorconfig` | Cross-editor baseline (indent size, line endings, charset) |
| Husky + `pre-commit` hook | Fast check on staged files: `biome ci --changed` |
| Husky + `pre-push` hook | Full check: `biome ci && tsc --noEmit && vitest run` |
| `.github/workflows/checks.yml` | CI — Biome only, runs on every push and PR |
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | CI — compile + typecheck + tests, runs on PR and main |

Scaffold conditionally based on detection:

| Condition | Additional Scaffolding |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `.compact` file detected | Vitest + `@openzeppelin-compact/contracts-simulator` for contract unit tests |
| Frontend / DApp detected | Playwright (headless only — never interactive) for E2E tests |

## Biome Configuration

Use the OpenZeppelin compact-contracts `biome.json` as the reference implementation. Key settings:

- VCS integration enabled (`vcs.enabled: true`, `vcs.clientKind: "git"`, `vcs.useIgnoreFile: true`)
- Formatter: single quotes, semicolons required, 2-space indent (spaces, not tabs)
- All rules at `"error"` level — warnings are not actionable in CI
- Excludes: `managed/` (Compact compiler output), `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `coverage/`

See `references/biome-config.md` for the full annotated `biome.json` template.

## Husky Hooks

```bash
# Install
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky init
```

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit — fast staged-file check
npx biome ci --changed
```

```bash
# .husky/pre-push — full suite
npx biome ci && npx tsc --noEmit && npx vitest run
```

The pre-commit hook uses `--changed` to check only staged files, keeping it under 2 seconds on most projects. The pre-push hook runs the full suite to prevent broken code from reaching the remote.

## CI Workflows

Two workflows keep CI fast and targeted:

**`checks.yml`** — fast, runs on every push and pull_request:
- Checkout → install → `biome ci`
- Fails immediately on any lint or format violation

**`test.yml`** — thorough, runs on pull_request and push to `main`:
- Checkout → install → `compact compile` (if Compact project) → `tsc --noEmit` → `vitest run`
- Playwright E2E runs as a separate job within this workflow (if DApp)

See `references/ci-workflows.md` for the full YAML for both workflows.
